      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

      <p>At Snake Oil Studios, we value your comments, suggestions and feedback. Our Privacy Policy sets out how we collect, use and disclose “personal information” and other “non personal information” we have gathered about you. What is Personal Information and why do we collect it from you? ‘Personal Information’ is information or an opinion that identifies you as an individual. We collect and store your email when you sign up for our newsletter, or where you nominate to specifically allow our games to collect your email. If you contact us directly for any reason, we may also keep a copy of that correspondence. Your email is collected only to keep you informed of new Snake Oil Studios products and changes to our existing products.</p>

      <h2>Newsletter</h2>

      <p>When you elect to join our mailing list for the purpose of receiving our newsletter we may use that “personal information” to provide you with direct marketing communications about upcoming games, features of our websites and other events and promotions related to our products. You may unsubscribe from our newsletter at any time. All you need to do is unsubscribe from the link in the letter, or let us know in writing that you want to be removed.</p>

      <h2>Sensitive Information</h2>

      <p>Sensitive information is defined in the US Privacy Act (1974) to include information or opinion about such things as an individual’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, membership of a political association, religious or philosophical beliefs, membership of a professional body, criminal records or health information.</p>

      <p>Snake Oil Studios will not attempt to obtain nor record any sensitive information.</p>

      <h2>Disclosure of Personal Information</h2>

      <h2>Security of Personal Information</h2>

      <p>Your Personal Information is stored offsite in a manner that reasonably protects it from misuse, loss, unauthorized access, modification or disclosure. We don’t guarantee website links or policy of authorised third parties and you access those sites at your own risk.</p>

      <h2>Access to your Personal Information</h2>

      <p>Under the Privacy Act, NPP 6 gives you the right to access the Personal Information we hold about you and to update and/or correct it, subject to certain exceptions. If you wish to access your Personal Information, please make out your request to us in writing at the address listed below.
